I created this repo three months ago. It covers all the commands, internship tasks, and workflow, etc., if you look at it carefully. For this week, I want to show you this and am uploading it. Due to a shortage of time, I wasn’t able to complete exactly the tasks mentioned in the notes, but I have learned up to this point. Kindly accept it. From next week, I will continue learning and move forward.
